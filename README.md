# Logstash MMDB Plugin

This is a MMDB filter plugin for
[Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash). Using a tool such as
[json-to-mmdb](https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/json-to-mmdb), you can take the
data that's inside your IP Address Management tool (eg. a spreadsheet) and use
that to get extra value from your logs, enabling you to do cool things with your
internal network ranges, such as:

- enrich an IP with the subnet address or VLAN ID or name
- enrich an IP with extra data that might represent which something significant,
  such as what type of traffic might be expected from that, or which part of the
  network it is coming from, such as Datacentre, DMZ, VPN, Wifi, Guest Wifi,
  Building X, Campus Y, etc.
- locate your private address ranges with coordinates or a geohash

This unlocks the aggregate on really-useful criteria:

- network logs relating to a particular VLAN perhaps?
- which parts of the network are we seeing this error on?
- show me web accesses from our VPN ranges
- are traffic flows still healthy for different parts of the network post-change?
- provides a useful feature for potential real-time machine-learning

You, as the MMDB database creator, are in total control of what goes into the
MMDB and which fields you want to extract inside of Logstash.

## install plugin

1. download `logstash-filter-mmdb-2.0.0.gem` from [Release](https://github.com/Aliang-code/logstash-filter-mmdb/releases)
2. exec `bin/logstash-plugin install path/to/logstash-filter-mmdb-2.0.0.gem`

> **NOTE**  require logstash-filter-geoip 7.3.0+ to use same mmdb version

## Sample Configuration

A useful Logstash filter configuration would look something like the following:

```
filter {
    mmdb {
        source => "ip"
        target => "ipinfo"
        database => "/path/to/demo.mmdb"
        #support nested map and convert field name
        fields => ["subnet", "name", "vlan_id", "country.name:country_name"]
    }
}
```

Let's assume that you have created a MMDB file using
[json-to-mmdb](https://github.com/cameronkerrnz/json-to-mmdb), and the input
for that looked like the following:

```
{
    "schema": {
        "database_type": "demo-network",
        "description": { "en": "Demo network allocations" },
        "ip_version": 4,
        "types": {
            "vlan_id": "uint32",
            "name": "utf8_string",
            "campus": "utf8_string",
            "country": "map"
        }
    },
    "allocations": [
        {
            "subnet": "10.10.0.0/16",   <--- REQUIRED FIELD
            "name": "Datacenter range",
            "campus": "Head Office",
            "country": {
               "name": "US"
             }
        },
        {
            "subnet": "10.10.0.0/20",
            "vlan_id": 1,
            "name": "Management interfaces",
            "campus": "Head Office",
            "country": {
               "name": "US"
             }
        },
        ...
```

Then an event such as the following (expressed as JSON)...

```
{
    "ip":"10.10.1.123",
    "message":"configuration changed"
}
```

...will result in the following output (expressed as JSON)...

```
{
    "ip":"10.10.1.123",
    "ipinfo": {
        "name": "Management interfaces",
        "vlan_id": 1,
        "subnet": "10.10.0.0/20",
        "country_name": "US"
    },
    "message":"configuration changed"
}
```

## build new version

recomment to use docker:
`sh build.sh`
